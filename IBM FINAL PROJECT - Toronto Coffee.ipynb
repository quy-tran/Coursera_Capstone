    " 2. **Data & usage:**  We will use a number of different data sources to explore neighborhoods and postal codes.\n",
    " \n",
    " a) 2016 population census Canada for population: https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/hlt-fst/pd-pl/Tables/File.cfm?T=1201&SR=1&RPP=9999&PR=0&CMA=0&CSD=0&S=22&O=A&Lang=Eng&OFT=CSV\n",

    "  b) postal codes and their neighborhoods: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M  \n",
    "      -- as people may be more familiar with Nieghborhoods then with postal codes\n",
    "      \n",
    "  c) foursqure data API (foursquare developer credentials required) \n",
    "  -- We will be pulling in latitudes and longitudes of all venues within 500 metres ( as this is an indication of foot traffic)\n",
    "  -- We will also pull in categories of these venues and find out how many of these venues are coffee shops and cafes to understand the competition in the area. \n",
    "  \n",
    " 3. **Assumptions:**  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  a) Venues that are not coffee shops (e.g. parks, businesses, restaurants), create good foot traffic for coffee shops  \n",
    "  b) Coffee shops within the same Postcode are bad for traffic as it is competition\n",
    "  c) A % of the Population of that Postcode will be considered foot traffic for that coffee shop\n",

    "# Methodology\n",
    " 1. We collected Data of Toronto Neighborhoods by postal code, and population by postal code. \n",
    " 2. We then enriched the data with all venues within 500 metre radius of that postal code.\n",
    " 3. We also enriched our data by categorizing all Coffee shopes within that zip code.\n",
    " 4. We attributed an estimated foot traffic to our coffee shope by: \n",
    "    a) total population of Toronto/Total venue/ Total coffeeshops of the postal code in Toronto *1% (this is an estimate of how much foot traffic we would get as a result of nearby venues(e.g. parks, schools, restaurants)\n",
    "    b) Total population of the postal code/ Total cofeeshops of the postal code *1%\n",
