This repository will be mainly used for the IBM capstone project.

Data scrapping of Neighborhoods in Toronto and using foursquare API to understand venues within each neighborhood. 
We then do a cluster analysis to understand different characteristics of each Neighborhood based on venues present.

Some tools/libraries used: 
1. website scraping using Beautifulsoup
2. json and json_normalize to help normalize and handle json files
3. geopy to geolocate for mapping purposes
4. sklearn to do our cluster analysis
5. folium and matplotlib  to visualize clusters on a map
